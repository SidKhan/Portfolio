**Project 1**

**Predictive Modelling/Statistical Testing**

Insurance Forecast Using Regression Modelling 
Project implemented predictive analytic algorithms to obtain predictions of future insurance premiums. Identified and Visualize the relationships between the factors involved to formulate the efficient model for forecasting. 

**Overview**

	Identify the dependent and independent variables, that guided to calculate predictions and decisions.

	Develop the plots/visuals 

	Build the regression model and define the relationship with visuals

	Redefined the regression model by transforming variables for nonlinear relationships to address multicollinearity.

	Created correlation maps

	Validate the regression model
